In this dataset I needed to modify every column to retrieve it's original integer data, which I don't know how, but I'd really like to know, converted to a string
on importing the arff file to using it in DataFrame. For which I first converted the arff format data to csv through Pandas DataFrames.
I modified every column singly, I would be highly appreciated if anyone can help me with a function or any method used to operate same function (for instance, in this case
I applied lambda function to every column for split() function) of multiple column. And also, as to how to maintain the original orders of the columns.

I used Cross Validation first to look for better estimator among Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Support Vector.
And then I also used GridSearchCV without using Pipeline for 3 classifiers
